LAB 2 USER MANUAL

Overview
myshell is a Unix shell accepted commands that are interactive from keyboard, or extracted from a batch file
It supports a set of built in commands and is capable of both running external programs using child processes.

Input format
Command arguments and symbiols (<, >, >>, &) should be separated using whitespace (space and tabs)

2. Starting myshell
2.1 Prompt Mode (keyboard input)
Running myshell without any arguments displays a prompt which shows the present working directory. The prompt sample shows the following appearance
>myshell:/home/user/shell-lab$

2.2 Batch Mode (file input)
Run myshell with one argument: myshell batchfile
In batch mode, myshell reads commands from batchfile by each line and exits when end of file is reached. Only one batch file at a time.

3. Internal Commands (Built-ins)
Handled directly without external programs.

3.1 cd <directory>
Changes current directory to <directory>, outputs an error if it does not exist, and updates pwd variable.
- Absolute paths: '/' (e.g., cd /home)
- Relative paths don't start with '/' (e.g. cd ..)

3.2 clr
Clears terminal

3.3 dir <directory>
Lists contents of <directory>

3.4 environ
Displays environment variables for myshell.

3.5 echo <comment>
Prints <comment> then newline. If nothing comes after it, then it prints a blank line. Reduction of multiple spaces and/or tabs to one space.

3.6 help
Displays this manual (readme file) using the more command.

3.7 pause
Pauses myshell until ENTER is pressed

3.8 quit
Leaves myshell.

4. External Commands
Non internal commands treated as external programs ran by forking a child process and using exec, allowing parent to continue.

Examples: ls, pwd, cat file.txt, grep main myshell.c.

5. Environment Variables (shell and parent)
myshell uses two main environment variables:

5.1 shell
In parent, myshell sets: shell=/myshell, where /myshell is absolute path to executable.
Check using:
environ
and look for the "shell=" entry.

5.2 parent
For external commands, the child's environment contains:
parent=/myshell
indicating the shell that launched the process.

6. I/O Redirection
myshell supports input/output redirection for external commands.
Format example:
program arg1 arg2 < inputfile > outputfile

6.1 Input Redirection (<)
Replaces stdin with file. 
Example:
cat < input.txt

6.2 Output Redirection (>)
Replaces stdout with file
Example:
echo hello > out.txt

6.3 Output (>>)
Attaches stdout to the file; creates if not there. 
Example:
echo world >> out.txt

6.4 Redirection with Built-ins
Works with dir, environ, echo, help. 
Examples:
dir > d.txt
environ > e.txt
echo hello world > test.txt
help > manualC.txt
NOTE: (<) is not supported for internal commands.

7. Background Execution (&)
Support for background running in external programs. Adding '&' to the end of a command launches it in background to be returned immediately.
Example:
sleep 5 &
NOTE: Only for external commands.

8. Exiting myshell
Use 'quit' or press Ctrl+C
